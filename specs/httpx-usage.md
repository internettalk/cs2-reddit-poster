# HTTPX Usage Specification

This document specifies how the `httpx` library will be used for making HTTP requests, primarily for polling the Steam event feed.

## Purpose

`httpx` will be used to send HTTP GET requests to the specified Steam API endpoint to retrieve CS2 update information.

## Key Features to Utilize

*   **Synchronous Requests:** Given the single-threaded nature of the application, `httpx.Client` will be used for blocking I/O operations when making HTTP requests.
*   **Timeout Configuration:** Set appropriate timeouts (connect, read, write) for requests to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely in case of network issues or unresponsive servers.
*   **Error Handling:** Utilize `httpx` exceptions (e.g., `httpx.RequestError`, `httpx.HTTPStatusError`) to catch and handle various network and HTTP-related problems gracefully.
*   **Headers:** Set necessary HTTP headers, such as `User-Agent`, to mimic a legitimate browser or client, as required by the Steam API or to avoid being blocked.
The `origin` parameter in the URL (`origin=https://www.counter-strike.net`) is also a form of header information passed via query string, as per the provided URL.
*   **JSON Response Handling:** Use `response.json()` to parse the JSON data returned by the Steam API.

## Implementation Sketch

```python
import httpx

# Example (conceptual)
def fetch_steam_events(url: str):
    with httpx.Client() as client:
        try:
            response = client.get(url, timeout=10.0) # 10-second timeout
            response.raise_for_status() # Raises HTTPStatusError for 4xx/5xx responses
            return response.json()
        except httpx.RequestError as exc:
            # Log error: f"An error occurred while requesting {exc.request.url!r}."
            return None
        except httpx.HTTPStatusError as exc:
            # Log error: f"Error response {exc.response.status_code} while requesting {exc.request.url!r}."
            return None

# steam_event_url = "https://store.steampowered.com/events/ajaxgetpartnereventspageable/..."
# events_data = fetch_steam_events(steam_event_url)
```

## Considerations

*   **Client Instantiation:** A single `httpx.Client` instance will be used for the application's lifetime. This approach is generally more efficient for repeated calls to the same host due to connection pooling. The client will be initialized when the application starts and closed gracefully when it shuts down.
*   **Retry Mechanism:** For transient network errors, implementing a simple retry mechanism (e.g., with exponential backoff) could improve robustness. `httpx` can be integrated with libraries like `tenacity` for this purpose.
*   **Proxy Support (Future):** While not specified initially, `httpx` supports proxies if needed in the future.
