# Rich Usage Specification

This document outlines how the `rich` library will be used for enhancing Command Line Interface (CLI) operations and output.

## Purpose

`rich` will be used to provide more visually appealing, readable, and structured output in the console, primarily for:

*   Logging information (in conjunction with `loguru`).
*   Displaying status updates.
*   Presenting errors or warnings in a highlighted manner.

## Key Features to Utilize

*   **Console Output:** Use `rich.console.Console` for printing formatted text, tables, and other rich elements.
*   **Text Styling:** Employ features like colors, styles (bold, italic), and highlighting to differentiate types of information (e.g., errors in red, successes in green).
*   **Logging Handler:** Integrate `rich` with `loguru` (or the standard `logging` module if `loguru`'s direct integration is complex) to make log messages more readable. `rich.logging.RichHandler` is designed for this.
*   **Progress Bars:** If there are long-running discrete tasks (though less likely for a continuous polling service), `rich.progress` could be used. For continuous polling, status updates via styled text are more probable.
*   **Tables:** For displaying structured data in the console (e.g., a summary of recent polling attempts or successfully posted updates), `rich.table.Table` can be useful.
*   **Markdown:** `rich.markdown.Markdown` can render Markdown content in the console, which might be useful for displaying help text or detailed error messages.

## Implementation Ideas

*   **Status Updates:** During polling, messages like "Polling for updates...", "No new updates found.", "New update found: [Update Title]", "Posting to Reddit..." can be styled using `rich`.
*   **Error Display:** When errors occur (e.g., network error, API error), they can be printed in a distinct color (e.g., red) with clear formatting.
*   **Log Formatting:** `loguru` logs, when directed to the console, should be processed by `RichHandler` for improved readability, including timestamps, log levels, and messages with appropriate styling.

```python
# Conceptual example with RichHandler for logging
from rich.logging import RichHandler
from loguru import logger

logger.remove()
logger.add(
    RichHandler(show_path=False, omit_repeated_times=False, show_level=True, show_time=True, rich_tracebacks=True),
    format="{message}", # RichHandler handles its own formatting mostly
    level="INFO"
)

# logger.info("This is an informational message.")
# logger.warning("This is a warning.")
# logger.error("This is an error message with a traceback!", exc_info=True)
```

## Considerations

*   **Verbosity Control:** Provide a way to control the verbosity of console output (e.g., through command-line arguments or a configuration setting). `rich` output can be detailed, so different levels (e.g., quiet, normal, verbose) might be useful.
*   **Performance:** While `rich` is generally efficient, excessive use of complex rendering in very tight loops could impact performance. This is unlikely to be an issue for this application's typical workflow.
*   **Non-Interactive Environments:** Ensure that the output degrades gracefully or can be simplified if the application is run in an environment where rich formatting is not supported or desired (e.g., when redirecting output to a file, though `loguru`'s file sink would handle this separately).
